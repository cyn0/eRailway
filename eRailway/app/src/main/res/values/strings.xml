    <string name="about_us_description">
        On some random day, in a random cafe you see a bunch of nerdy guys who had lost their social life but with never ending thirst to create a better world, that would be us! \n
        We, team of three losers, spent several nights surviving on a mug of coffee so that we could create a simple, reliable and materialistic railway info application just for you.\n
        When we started, we were discouraged that how could we provide a better solution completing with big players in the market. But we know a very simple and materialistic design can make us stand apart.
